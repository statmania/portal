I want a web app to let user give info about train status: train name and which station has it crossed. I'll show this info on website beside train name. Also observing inpuyt time, I'll calculate how much has the train delayed.



1. My user can open an account by giving user_name and password and a security question to verify identity and chnage password later.

2. Then they can input train name and station it crossed.

3. Timestmp would be auto-collected.

I want to use a free database for storing these info. Info which are more than one day old would be deleted. Now what can I do? Give me the simplest solution.

Use these sample train info
