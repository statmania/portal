Can you make a js based pie chart just like this using user-input data? The web page would have 3 columns. In the left the user can input values in a table: column name and values (show 5 rows by default with some sample values.

The 2nd column shows the plot with download option under it.
The 3rd column in page layout allows user to choose color pallette.
